# Design Challenge

Using the [mtcars](/mtcars.csv) dataset, produce two different designs to show how you would present the data on a page in a web application. 
* Designs can be UML or other markup.
* Designs can be hand drawn.
* Designs should be added to this folder of the repository.
* Add a brief description of your designs below.

# Descriptions

## Design 1
This is a UML sequence diagram of a website that accesses the data on the mtcars.csv file.
The user interacts with the website to get the data displayed on the pages.

## Design 2
This UML diagram shows a class diagram and potential classes for a web application to display the data from mtcars.csv.
It does not state what the list of cars is for so I can assume it is either a car dealership or a car rental agency.
For this design I am assuming it is a car rental agency where the client can only rent one car at a time.
