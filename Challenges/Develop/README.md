# Develop Challenge

This challenge is to create a simple application with a very basic user interface.

## Requirements

* A console application in C# or Java. 
* Can read the [mtcars](/mtcars.csv) dataset & display it.
* Allows editing of rows.
* Can save data back to the csv.

## Aditional
* Implement a sorting algorithm, and add an option to sort the dataset before saving
* Input Validation.

# Summary
Write a brief summary of additional changes you would propose to improve the application.

In this task I made a C# .NET Console application that will take the mtcars.csv file read it and build a list of a cars class using the data provided in the csv, the connection to the csv is then closed.
When the user does an action to change the data like sort or edit one entry it saves the data and then displays it back to the user but updated.
Additional changes that could improve the application are ways to remove entries and an improved user interface as the console makes it hard to see the categories.
